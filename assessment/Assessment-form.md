# Assessment form for the Scipy tutorial: preliminar questions

### What is the primary difference between geographic and projected coordinate reference systems?

- Geographic coordinate reference systems use latitude and longitude while projected coordinate reference systems use XY coordinates.
- Geographic coordinate reference systems are three-dimensional while projected coordinate reference systems are two-dimensional.
- Projected coordinate reference systems can only be used in the southern hemisphere.
- Geographic coordinate reference systems use the prime meridian as the origin while projected coordinate reference systems use the equator.

### What is the reference line for latitude in the geographic coordinate system?

- The prime meridian
- The equator
- The North pole
- The South pole

### Which statement is true about lines of longitude?

- They run parallel to the equator.
- They are assigned positive values in the southern hemisphere.
- They converge at the poles.
- The distance between lines of longitude is the same at all latitudes.

### What is the origin point for the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate reference system?

- The North pole
- The South pole
- The equator at a specific Longitude
- Greenwich England

### Which file is mandatory for a shapefile to represent spatial vector data?

- .prj
- .xml
- .shp
- .cpg

### What type of data does GeoJSON format encode?

- Raster data
- Vector data
- Both raster and vector data
- Metadata for geospatial images

### NASA EarthData

**Have you accessed NASA EarthData Cloud before this tutorial?**

- Yes
- No

**How difficult do you find the process of accessing data from NASA EarthData Cloud?**

- Very easy: I could access and retrieve data without any issues.
- Somewhat easy: I could access data but I encountered minor difficulties.
- Challenging: I encountered significant difficulties or was unable to access the data.

**Have you used NASA EarthData products in your research or projects before this tutorial?**

- Yes
- No

**Do you feel confident in extracting and processing data from NASA EarthData Cloud after this tutorial?**

- Very confident: I can extract and process data independently and efficiently.
- Somewhat confident: I can extract and process data but may need occasional assistance.
- Not confident: I still feel unsure about extracting and processing data on my own.
