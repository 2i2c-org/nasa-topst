# Geospatial data

## Vector data
Vector data is split into three types: point, line, and polygon data.^1^

**Point data**
Point data is most commonly used to represent nonadjacent features and to represent discrete data points. Points have zero dimensions, therefore you can measure neither length or area with this dataset.^1^

**Line Data**
Line data is used to represent linear features. Common examples would be rivers, trails, and streets.  Line features only have one dimension and therefore can only be used to measure length.  Line features have a starting and ending point. Common examples would be road centerlines and hydrology.^1^

**Polygon data**
Polygons are used to represent areas such as the boundary of a city (on a large scale map), lake, or forest.  Polygon features are two dimensional and therefore can be used to measure the area and perimeter of a geographic feature.^1^

## Raster data
Raster data represents geographic data as a matrix of cells that each contains an attribute value. While the area of different polygon shapes in a data set can differ, each cell in a raster data set is the same cell. The size of the area in the real world that each cell represents is known as the spatial resolution.^1^
