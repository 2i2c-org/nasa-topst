As with the DIST products, the DSWx products consist of raster data stored in GeoTIFF format using the [Military Grid Reference System (MGRS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Grid_Reference_System) (the details are fully described in the [DSWx product specification](https://d2pn8kiwq2w21t.cloudfront.net/documents/ProductSpec_DSWX_URS309746.pdf)).
