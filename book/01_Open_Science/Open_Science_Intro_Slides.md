## About this tutorial
* Use data available through the NASA Earthdata Cloud to understand and forecast environmental risks such as wildfire, drought, and floods.
* Analyze, visualize, and report on data through open science-based workflows and the use of cloud-based data computing.


## What is Open Science?
***The principle and practice of making research products and processes available to all, while respecting diverse cultures, maintaining security and privacy, and fostering collaborations, reproducibility, and equity***

### What open science resources are available?

- Over 100 Petabytes of openly available NASA Earthdata.
- Online platforms for data sharing and collaboration.
- Publicly accessible code repositories and development tools.


### What are the benefits of Open Science?

- Enhances the discoverability and accessibility of scientific processes and outputs.
- Open methods enhance reproducibility.
- Transparency and verifiability enhance accuracy.
- Scrutiny of analytic decisions promotes trust.
- Accessible data and collective efforts accelerate discoveries.
- Open science fosters inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility (IDEA).
- And much more..

## Where to start? Open Research Products

Scientific knowledge, or research products, take the form of:

#### Data

Scientifically relevant information in digital format.
- Examples: mission data, calibration details, metadata.

#### Code

Software used in scientific computing.
- Types: general purpose, libraries, modeling, analysis, single-use.

#### Results

Various research outputs showcasing scientific findings.
- Examples: publications, notebooks, presentations, blog posts.
