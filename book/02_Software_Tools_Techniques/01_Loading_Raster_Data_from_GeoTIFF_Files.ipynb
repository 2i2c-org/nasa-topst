The easiest solution is to use [rioxarray](https://corteva.github.io/rioxarray/html/index.html); this solution takes care of a lot of tricky details transparently. We can also use [Rasterio](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/stable) as a tool for reading data or metadata from GeoTIFF files; judicious use of Rasterio can make a big difference when working with remote files in the cloud."
